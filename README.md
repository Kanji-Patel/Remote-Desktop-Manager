Remote-Desktop-Manager
======================

Remote Desktop Services is one of Microsoft Windows components to access a remote computer through the network. Only the user interface of the application is presented at the client. Any input is redirected over to the remote computer over the network.


At work, we use Remote Desktop a great deal. It allows us to login to a remote server to perform health checks, deploy applications, troubleshoot problems, etc. We also use remote desktop often when we do WFH (work from home).


Remote Desktop is very useful for managing remote computers. I have decided to expand remote desktop to a level where user can do multiple remote machine in one application.
